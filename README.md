# 6DOF_rocket_sim
6DOF Rocket Simulation Tool:
  Basic setup currently with static engine. Uses Modified Rodrigues Parameter as the attitude formalism, with dynamics expressed in them.
  
  Todo:
  [x] add atmospheric drag
  [] add attitude dependant drag / lift
  [] add EKF law with sensors
  [] add general cold gas thruster sim
  [] add TVC controller
