# 6DOF_rocket_sim
6DOF Rocket Simulation Tool:
  Basic setup currently with static engine. Uses Modified Rodrigues Parameter as the attitude formalism, with dynamics expressed in them.
  I will be adding basic attitude stabilize mode soon using on/off cold gas thrusters. Also an EKF with degenerate state feedback.
  
  This simulation framework is to test estimation and control laws for a current suborbital liquid rocket development project.
