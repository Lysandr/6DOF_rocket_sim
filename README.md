# 6DOF Rocket Simulation Tool:
This is a basic translational and rotational simulation tool with RK4 integrator. It uses a single engined liquid engine (for now) and includes mass depletion dynamics. This uses Modified Rodrigues Parameter as the attitude formalism, with dynamics expressed in them.
  
  #### Todo:
    -[x] add atmospheric drag
    -[] add attitude dependant drag / lift
    -[] add EKF law with sensors
    -[] add general cold gas thruster sim
    -[] add TVC controller
